This introduces multiple changes:

- the requirements are formatted to be shorter and normalized
- the TOML is now formatted via https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/configuration/formatter-options.html
- will force arrays to be multiline (can use the column_width configuration to trigger this realign less aggressive)
- now supports min python version setting via cli/config
- normalizes project fields to use string instead of string literal
- collapses project sub tables to be inline within the project table
- comments are now attached to the next entry and moved alongside entries during re-ordering/sorting
